title: Nixie Clock v1.0
---
I worked on this project from 2014 to 2015 (starting in my final year of school and finishing during my first year at university). The hardware is fairly standard for a nixie tube clock (arduino, DS1307 RTC, nixie tubes with driver ICs, high voltage supply module) but with the addition of a GPS module for precise timing synchronisation.

*Testing the nixie tubes before final assembly. The wire spaghetti is due to the fact that the PCBs are single layer through hole boards, photo etched at school since I did not have the tools (or money!) for SMD assembly at the time.*

As of 2021 the clock is still working!
