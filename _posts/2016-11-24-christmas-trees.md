A simple christmas tree ornament using RGB LEDs and an ARM-M0 based microcontroller to fade between colours. Each ornament is made up of two PCBs that slot together, with solder used to join the boards physically and electrically. The boards can be powered with a AAA battery or via micro USB.

This project was inspired by [Adam Greig's *yuletronics* project](https://github.com/adamgreig/yuletronics).
